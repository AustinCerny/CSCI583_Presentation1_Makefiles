# Make Uses: Project Managment
#
#
* Make is used to manage large software projecs where certain files can be changed without necessarily requiring all files to be recompiled.
    * Makefiles keep track of program dependencies and will only rebuild an executable if it has libraries or dependencies that have been updated
 
     
**Example:** The Linux Kernel

* Compiling the Linux Kernel from scratch will usually take several hours. However, after appropriately using Make, any subsequent builds with only small chages to the kernel will compile in minutes instead.
