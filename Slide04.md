* There are many flavors of Make
    * GNU Make is specific to Linux/OS X
    * nmake is specific to Microsoft systems
* The basic principles of Make remain consistent across these platforms. 
* Separate flavors of Make are sometimes necessary because compilers often behave differently across different platforms
* There are cross platform versions of Make which are capable of generating platform specific instructions
    * CMake is a common example
    * Using these versions of make usually require more rules to be specified by a user
